## Generate an application

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:app my-app` to generate an application.


## Generate a library

Run `nx g @nrwl/react:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. 

## Nx cheatsheet and tools

### Create a new App or Lib

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use any of the plugins in the community to generate applications

**Create new React app**
```sh
npx nx g @nwrl/react:app <app_name>
```

**Create new NextJS app**
```sh
npx nx g @nrwl/next:app <app_name>
```

**Create a new React Component library**
```sh
npx nx g @nwrl/react:lib <lib_name>
```

### Code scaffolding

Whit the help of generators, Nx allows to do code scaffolding 

**Generate a new Reacn Component**
```sh
npx nx g @nrwl/react:component BottomNav --project=ui-components --style=styled-components --export
```

### Visualize packages dependencies
```sh
npx nx dep-graph
```

## Development 

### Start app in dev mode

To Run the dev server. 
```sh
npx nx insights-app:serve
```
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Storybook

#### Add Storybook config to a app or lib
```sh
nx g @nrwl/react:storybook-configuration <project-name>
`

> This also regenerates `stories` for all components that don't have any defined

#### Run storybook
```sh
npx nx run ui-components:storybook
`

## Build

Run `nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.
